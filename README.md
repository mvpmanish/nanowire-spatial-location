# nanowire-spatial-location
An algorithm to find matching nanowires from a set of nanowires in a fixed spatial configuration and the same set under an unkown transformation. The algorithm uses kd-trees, nearest-neighbour searching, and geometric hash mapping.

The example dataset is given as a text file and contains information about a nanowire set.
